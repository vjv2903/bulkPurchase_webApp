# Bulk Purchase App 

Web application based on MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Introduction

- Frontend in ​ **React.js**
- Backend using ​ **Express.js​** which implements a ​ **REST​** API
- Database in ​ **MongoDB**

The app proposes to solve a major problem that the students of our college face. There are
times when one wants to buy an item, only to find that buying them in bulk would make it much
cheaper as opposed to buying a single unit. The app will have an option for sellers to host their
products along with the minimum bulk dispatch quantity. Various customers can select from
the listed products and order them with their own required quantity. When enough orders are
placed for the product and bulk quantity requirements are met, the vendor can dispatch the
order.
